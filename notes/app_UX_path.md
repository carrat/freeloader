### Freeloader

## Opening Screen
A screen that appears on page load that introduces the app to the user and collectes their first input:
City, Address, and range

### Alternative: Login Screen
If we choose to use a login feature, the opening screen user input would change to logging in with account or alternatively, creating an account

### Alternative: Account Screen 
After login, we could output whatever user data is stored in account: last starting location, last range...maybe these just prepopulate user input fields or maybe we have more detailed information

## Output Screen
The next screen will output the results from the data entry to the screen with two elements: map and item list in sidebar
